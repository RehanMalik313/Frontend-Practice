#Task03:
#Create a list of six school subjects. Ask the user which of these subjects they donâ€™t like. Delete the subject they have chosen from the list before you display the list again.

school_subj = ['math', 'english', 'science', 'bio', 'urdu', 'chemistry']
print(school_subj)
print()
user = input('Which subject you don`t like: ' )
getrid = school_subj.index(user)
del school_subj[getrid]
print(school_subj)

#Another Logic:

school_subj = ['math', 'english', 'science', 'bio', 'urdu', 'chemistry']
print(school_subj)
print()
user = input('Which subject you don`t like: ' )
if user in school_subj:
    school_subj.remove(user)
    print(school_subj)
else:
    print(f'{user} is not in the list.')
